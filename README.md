# Rust library for parsing Linux perf tool output (perf.data)
Currently just support of main events are implemented. It was part of other project which hasn't been finished. If you are interested in this library let me know.

Documentation: https://docs.rs/linux-perf-file-reader/latest/linux_perf_file_reader/

Dump of a perf.data from `sleep`: https://github.com/mikhail-m1/linux-perf-file-reader/blob/master/tests/dump.stdout 

## To Do
* Support more events.
* Check performance on big files.

## Contribution
Any feedback is wellcome.
